 * UIKit:
 * For static image format, this value is always 0.
 * For animated image format, 0 means infinite looping.
 * Note that because of the limitations of categories this property can get out of sync if you create another instance with CGImage or other methods.
 * AppKit:
 * NSImage currently only support animated via GIF imageRep unlike UIImage.
 * The getter of this property will get the loop count from GIF imageRep
 * The setter of this property will set the loop count from GIF imageRep
